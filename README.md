## 📁 Featured Projects  

### 🧩 [Text-to-SQL LLM Copilot (FastAPI | SQLite | OpenAI | SQLGlot)](https://github.com/KashyapAva/API-SQL-LLM)  
Built a FastAPI microservice that converts natural-language queries into validated SQL.  
Integrated OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini with schema introspection and SQLGlot guardrails, achieving **>95% query accuracy**.  
Automated ELT with pandas + SQLAlchemy, Swagger testing, and `.env` configurations for **reproducible deployment**.  

---

### 📈 [Equity Factor Analysis with dbt + DuckDB (CAPM & Fama-French 5)](https://github.com/KashyapAva/etl-capm-ff5)  
Developed a **reproducible dbt pipeline** to ingest and test Fama-French & monthly equity data (6 models, 12 tests, 100% pass).  
Ran CAPM & FF5 regressions in Python to identify statistically significant alphas and quantify factor fits (**R² = 0.18–0.67**).  
Demonstrated **modern analytics engineering principles** using data lineage, schema testing, and modular ETL design.  

---

### 📊 [Retail KPI Dashboard](https://github.com/KashyapAva/retail-kpi-powerbi-dashboard)  
Built an end-to-end **Power BI solution** integrating multiple datasets into a unified semantic model.  
Created **15+ DAX measures** and interactive dashboards for tracking KPIs — Revenue, AOV, Gross Margin %, Conversion Rate, CAC, ROAS, and YoY Growth.  

---

### 🌾 [Methane Flux Prediction using RNN & LSTM](https://github.com/KashyapAva/methane-flux-prediction)  
Forecasted methane emissions in maize fields using **deep learning models** trained on eddy-covariance sensor data.  
Benchmarked LSTM, Random Forest, and SARIMA models, improving **MAPE from 103% → 15%** by modeling key drivers (soil moisture, air temperature).  

---

### 💰 [Income Prediction using Logistic & Probit Models](https://github.com/KashyapAva/income-prediction)  
Predicted income > $50K on UCI Census data using logistic regression and GLMs with a **probit link**.  
Achieved **AUC = 0.894** and implemented automated preprocessing pipelines in MySQL + SAS.  

---

### ⚙️ [Reducing CO Emissions in Turbine Output](https://github.com/KashyapAva/co-emission-optimization)  
Applied regression, LASSO, decision trees, and random forests to optimize turbine parameters and minimize CO output.  
Identified key predictors (**CDP > 12 mbar, TIT > 1085 °C**) and achieved **RMSE = 0.504**.  

---

### 🧬 [Parkinson’s Disease Progression Prediction](https://github.com/KashyapAva/parkinsons-progression)  
Predicted UPDRS scores from clinical and protein data using LSTM, LightGBM, CatBoost, and SVR models.  
Enhanced interpretability through SHAP analysis and improved progression tracking accuracy.  

---

### 🖼️ [Image Generation with GANs and DIP-VAEs](https://github.com/KashyapAva/image-generation-comparison)  
Compared **GANs vs. Disentangled VAEs** on MNIST & SVHN datasets to analyze image quality, latent structure, and training stability.  

---

### 🧮 [Optimization in Deep Networks](https://github.com/KashyapAva/implicit-acceleration)  
Theoretical study demonstrating how **overparameterization accelerates gradient descent** via implicit preconditioning.  

---

### 🚦 [Context-Aware Traffic Accident Severity Prediction](https://github.com/KashyapAva/traffic-severity-modeling)  
Modeled accident severity using spatial and seasonal features with **ensemble learning** and **hotspot detection**.  
Implemented undersampling techniques to balance class distributions and improve generalization.
