# 👋 Hi, I'm Kashyap Ava
🎓 Master's in Statistics @ UIUC | 🎯 Data Analyst & ML Enthusiast

## 📊 My Interests
- Time series forecasting
- Predictive modeling
- Statistical learning & experimental design

## 📁 Projects
- [Retail KPI Dashboard](https://github.com/KashyapAva/retail-kpi-powerbi-dashboard): Built an end-to-end BI solution in Power BI by integrating multiple datasets into a single semantic model. Developed 15+ DAX measures and interactive dashboards with slicers, drill-downs, and dynamic titles for KPI tracking (Revenue, AOV, Gross Margin %, Conversion Rate, CAC, ROAS, YoY Growth).  
- [Methane Flux Prediction using RNN & LSTM](https://github.com/KashyapAva/methane-prediction): Forecasted methane emissions in maize fields using deep learning models trained on environmental sensor data.  
- [Income Prediction using Logistic & Probit Models](https://github.com/KashyapAva/income-prediction): Classified income levels on UCI Census data using logistic regression and GLM with probit link.  
- [Reducing CO Emissions in Turbine Output](https://github.com/KashyapAva/turbine-co-reduction): Applied regression, LASSO, decision trees, and random forests to optimize turbine parameters and reduce carbon monoxide emissions.  
- [Parkinson’s Disease Progression Prediction](https://github.com/KashyapAva/parkinsons-progression): Predicted UPDRS scores from clinical and protein data using LSTM, LightGBM, CatBoost, and SVR models.  
- [Image Generation with GANs and DIP-VAEs](https://github.com/KashyapAva/image-generation-gan-dipvae): Compared GANs and disentangled VAEs on MNIST and SVHN datasets to analyze image quality, latent structure, and training stability.  
- [Optimization in Deep Networks: Implicit Acceleration by Overparameterization](https://github.com/KashyapAva/implicit-acceleration): Theoretical study showing how network depth accelerates gradient descent via implicit preconditioning.  
- [Context-Aware Traffic Accident Severity Prediction](https://github.com/KashyapAva/accident-severity-prediction): Modeled accident severity using spatial and seasonal features with ensemble learning, hotspot detection, and undersampling.
