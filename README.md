## 📁 Projects
- [Methane Flux Prediction using RNN & LSTM](https://github.com/kashyapava/methane-prediction): Time series forecasting of methane emissions in maize fields using deep learning models trained on environmental sensor data.
- [Income Prediction using Logistic & Probit Models](https://github.com/kashyapava/income-prediction): Classification of income levels using logistic regression and GLM with probit link, based on UCI Census data.
- [Reducing CO Emissions in Turbine Output](https://github.com/kashyapava/turbine-co-reduction): Statistical consulting project using regression, LASSO, decision trees, and random forests to optimize controllable turbine variables and reduce carbon monoxide emissions.
- [Parkinson’s Disease Progression Prediction](https://github.com/kashyapava/parkinsons-progression): Machine learning models, including LSTM, LightGBM, CatBoost, and SVR, applied to clinical and protein data for predicting UPDRS scores in Parkinson’s disease patients.
- [Image Generation with GANs and DIP-VAEs](https://github.com/kashyapava/image-generation-gan-dipvae): Comparison of GANs and disentangled VAEs on MNIST and SVHN datasets, analyzing image quality, latent structure, and training stability.
- [Optimization in Deep Networks: Implicit Acceleration by Overparameterization](https://github.com/kashyapava/implicit-acceleration): Theoretical study demonstrating how depth in linear networks accelerates gradient descent through implicit preconditioning, independent of expressiveness.
- [Context-Aware Traffic Accident Severity Prediction](https://github.com/kashyapava/accident-severity-prediction): Spatial and seasonal ML modeling using US Accidents data to predict severity, incorporating hotspot detection, undersampling, and ensemble learning.
