# 👋 Hi, I’m Kashyap Ava

🎓 **M.S. Statistics @ UIUC**  
🧠 **Data Scientist / Applied AI Engineer** — GenAI, Statistical Modeling, Analytics Engineering

I build **end-to-end, production-minded data and GenAI systems** — from ingestion and retrieval to modeling, APIs, and user-facing tools.  
My work combines **statistical rigor**, **modern ML/LLMs**, and **reproducible pipelines** to turn raw data into reliable, decision-ready insights.

## 🔥 Featured Projects

### 🤖 [Local RAG Chatbot (LLM, FAISS, FastAPI, Streamlit)](https://github.com/KashyapAva/local-rag-chatbot)
Built an end-to-end **local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for grounded Q&A over PDF/Markdown documents.  
Implemented similarity-thresholded FAISS retrieval, deterministic local LLM inference (Phi-3-mini), and a FastAPI backend with a Streamlit demo UI, focusing on **hallucination control, explainability, and system reliability**.

### 🧩 [Text-to-SQL Analytics Assistant (LLM, FastAPI, SQLGlot)](https://github.com/KashyapAva/API-SQL-LLM)
Built a FastAPI microservice converting natural-language questions into **validated SQL** over a relational dataset.  
Added schema-aware prompting and SQLGlot guardrails, achieving **95%+ query accuracy** with **zero invalid SQL executions** in testing.

---

### 📈 [Equity Factor Analytics — dbt + DuckDB (CAPM & Fama-French 5)](https://github.com/KashyapAva/etl-capm-ff5)
Developed a **reproducible analytics engineering pipeline** using dbt and DuckDB with tests, lineage, and modular ELT design.  
Ran CAPM and FF5 regressions to quantify factor exposure and alpha (**R² = 0.18–0.67**), demonstrating production-style financial analytics.

---

### 📊 [Retail KPI Dashboard (Power BI, DAX)](https://github.com/KashyapAva/retail-kpi-powerbi-dashboard)
Designed an end-to-end **Power BI analytics solution** with 15+ DAX measures to track revenue, AOV, gross margin %, CAC, ROAS, and YoY growth for retail performance monitoring.

---

### 🌾 [Long-Term Rice Field Trial Analytics (Mixed-Effects Modeling)](https://github.com/KashyapAva/field-trial-mixed-models)
Analyzed **50+ years of agronomic field-trial data** using mixed-effects models (split-plot RCBD) for valid inference.  
Performed trial QC, visual diagnostics, and delivered **field-ready recommendations** with publication-quality outputs.

## 📌 Additional Selected Projects

### 🌾 [Methane Flux Prediction (LSTM, RF, SARIMA)](https://github.com/KashyapAva/methane-prediction)
Forecasted methane emissions from eddy-covariance sensor data, improving **MAPE from 103% → 15%** by modeling key environmental drivers such as soil moisture and temperature.

### 🧬 [Parkinson’s Disease Progression Modeling](https://github.com/KashyapAva/parkinsons-progression)
Predicted UPDRS progression using LSTM, LightGBM, CatBoost, and SVR models, with **SHAP-based interpretability** for clinical insight.

### 💰 [Income Prediction with GLMs (Logit & Probit)](https://github.com/KashyapAva/income-prediction)
Modeled income classification on UCI Census data using logistic and probit GLMs, achieving **AUC = 0.894** with automated preprocessing pipelines.

### ⚙️ [CO Emissions Optimization in Turbine Output](https://github.com/KashyapAva/turbine-co-reduction)
Applied regression, LASSO, and tree-based models to reduce turbine CO emissions, identifying key operational thresholds and achieving **RMSE = 0.504**.
